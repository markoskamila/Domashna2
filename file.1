These large carnivores are powerfully built with long bodies, relatively short legs, and a broad head. 

There are nine subspecies and are distinguished by the unique characteristics of their coats, which range from tawny or light yellow in warm, 
dry habitats to reddish-orange in dense forests. 

Their coat is covered in dark, irregular spots called rosettes. 
These spots are circular in east African leopards, but square in southern African leopards.
