THESE LARGE CARNIVORES ARE POWERFULLY BUILT WITH 
LONG BODIES AND A BROAD HEAD.

There are nine subspecies and are distinguished by the unique 
characteristics of their coats, which range from tawny or light 
yellow in warm, dry habitats to reddish-orange in dense forests. 

These spots are circular in east African leopards, 
but square in southern African leopards.
